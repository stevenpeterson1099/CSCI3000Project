AES
	The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES is the standard used for the US government to protect its classified information. AES is one of the most widely used encryption standards to this day.


DES
	Developed by IBM in the early 1970â€™s, Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric key algorithm for encryption of digital data. Having a relatively short and insecure 56-bit key size, DES cipher is largely obsolete in today's standards, yet its creation has been highly influential in the advancement of cryptography. 


RC4:
	Also known as ARC4, RC4 is a stream cipher. A stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher, where plaintext digits are combined with a sudo-random cipher stream. RC4 has been known for its simplicity, as well as its speed. However, there have been vulnerabilities, rendering it insecure. Some of the real-world applications of RC4 include: Microsoft Office, Secure Socket Layer (SSL), and Wired Equivalent Privacy(WEP).


Blowfish: 
Blowfish is a symmetric encryption (use the same key for encrypt and decrypt), designed by Bruce Schneier in 1993. It is also a block cipher and the block length is 64 bits. (divides a message up into fixed length blocks during encryption and decryption). It can be used as a replacement for AES and DES. It is faster encryption than DES. Blowfish is free for all uses. 


Vigenere
The Vigenere cipher uses a form of polyalphabetic substitution and was first described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553. It went unbroken until 1863. Also known as the indecipherable cipher, it uses a series of connected Caesar ciphers based on a codeword applied to the Vigenere square.
